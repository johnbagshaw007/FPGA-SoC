[clk_div_opt.v]: A versatile, parameterized clock divider designed for precision and flexibility. Crafted with the industry-standard timescale of 1ns/1ps.


At its core lies the MAX_COUNT parameter, set to 4'd15, offering a customizable division range to accommodate various timing needs. 

Four meticulously calibrated outputs (div2, div4, div8, div16) provide divided clock signals, each a binary step down from the master clk, 

granting designers the power to synchronize operations across a spectrum of frequencies.

The module thrives on simplicity and efficiency, with a 4-bit register count incrementing on each rising edge of clkâ€”but only when enabled by en. 

A synchronous reset rst ensures a clean start, resetting the count to zero and reinforcing deterministic behavior.
